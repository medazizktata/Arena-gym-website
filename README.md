Project Installation Documentation

This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up the project locally on your machine. The project is built with React using Vite as the bundler, and npm as the package manager.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine. You can download and install them from here.
Git should be installed on your machine. You can download and install it from here.

## 📦 Create a New Project

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
npm run dev # Start the development server
